    <p>In a world where countries have enough trouble communicating with each 
        other, dealing with language barriers only makes it that much harder to 
        keep peace in the world. This is where translation comes into play: 
        translation allows people who speak different languages to communicate 
        easily. The art of translation plays an important role in how we view and 
        communicate with people in other countries.</p>
    <p>Verbal translation can happen every day within the mind of a bilingual 
        person. Even in our own language, sometimes we have to translate into 
        words we understand. Written translation between two different languages, 
        particularly of books and literary works, allows us to bring a new aspect 
        of language into our lives - we are able to read and understand something 
        that was originally written in a language we donâ€™t understand. Translators 
        play a very important role in the connection between different countries, 
        whether they translate verbally or written works. Both are equally 
        important in the connection between cultures in the world.</p>
    <p>Translation may seem like an easy task, something that Google Translate 
        can do for you instantly. However, true translation, translation that 
        includes emotion and idiomatic meaning can only be done by a human 
        translator. No matter how good machine translators get, they will never 
        be able to compare to the language a translator can communicate. The art 
        of translation is tricky, because one needs to have a very strong 
        understanding and ability of multiple languages. The ability to speak more 
        than one language is an experience like no other, an experience that every 
        person should be able to have.</p> 
    <p>Thus, we here at Burlington Translate are working towards making multi-lingual 
        texts available to as many people as possible. You can view some examples 
        on our <a href="sample-text.php">Sample Texts</a> page, and even put in a request for a text to be 
        translated on our <a href="form.php">Request a Translation</a> page. We want to bring the literature 
        of other cultures to you as easily as possible. Please visit our <a href="blog.php">blog</a> page 
        to see how other users have benefitted from our services, and request a 
        translation to begin your multi-lingual pursuit today.</p>
