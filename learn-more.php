  <p>Language is perhaps the most important development in our history as humans. 
      Though it is extremely difficult to know for sure how language began, and 
      what the exact origins of language are, since we have no record of when/where/how 
      it began, we do know that language has evolved a lot. A lot of study of language 
      and linguistics begins with the beginning of writing systems, because they 
      were the first to be able to document the spoken language. However, before 
      that, much of the history of language was oral, which is usually inaccurate, 
      and could not be documented until the invention of writing systems. Despite 
      these difficulties, we have been able to study hundreds, even thousands, of 
      years of the history of language. Language is continuously evolving, and the 
      languages we speak today are often different than their original languages. 
      There is so much to learn about language, and we are always discovering new 
      things about language.</p>
  <p>Most people don’t stop to think about how amazing it is that we can communicate 
      what we think and feel and see using strings of characters or sounds, that 
      to someone with no knowledge of a language, would seem like complete nonsense. 
      However, we are all able to communicate in our own languages, most people 
      having learned their native language without consciously trying, a feat that 
      to this day baffles linguists and neuroscientists. We may never fully understand 
      how we are able to speak and read and listen and communicate with others, 
      but we can, and that is something really amazing. There will always be many 
      unknowns about language and its origins, but what matters is that we continue 
      to try to discover everything we can about spoken and written language.</p>

  <h1>Why is Translation Important?</h1>

  <p>Learning a second language later in life is another phenomenon that amazes 
      linguists and neuroscientists. When we learn our native language, we aren’t 
      actively trying to learn; we just do. However, when we learn another language 
      later in life, we learn it in a different way. We learn how to speak another 
      language by learning its rules, and by learning to translate something from 
      our own language into another language. Learning a language uses special 
      parts of the brain, and studying how we learn a second language is extremely 
      difficult but interesting. When we learn a second language, every time we 
      speak or hear or read the second language, we translate into our own language.</p>
  <p>This translation is extremely difficult and interesting, because each person 
       has their own slightly different way of speaking a language. Translation 
       is difficult to do because of this slight difference in meaning that each 
       person understands, because of idiomatic and inflectional meanings of words 
       in different languages. This is why a machine can never accurately translate 
       like a human can - a machine doesn’t have the feelings and emotions that 
       go into understanding and speaking a language. Only a human can accurately 
       and meaningfully translate between languages, and that is only when one has 
       a deep knowledge of these languages.</p>
  <p>Translation allows people from two different cultures to communicate and 
      share ideas and beliefs, as well as stories and feelings. There is nothing 
      more amazing than being able to communicate with someone in their language, 
      a feeling that many people take for granted in this world. Learning another 
      language is one of the most important things you can do to enrich your life 
      - open yourself up to the life and culture of another country by learning 
      how to speak, listen and read another language. Allow translation to act as 
      a learning mode, as well as an appreciation for other languages. Learn and 
      never stop learning what it means to understand another language.</p>
