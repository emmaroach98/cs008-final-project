"Emma Roach, ",19,", is from Ithaca, New York, and is currently a student at the University of Vermont studying German and Linguistics. Translation has been a very important part of life for Emma, given the fact that she fluently speaks English and German, and also knows a bit of Italian and French. Language is one of the most important yet underrated parts of our lives because it is able to connect people in a very special and meaningful way, and being able to translate between two languages has been an experience unlike any other. Being able to connect with people in another country and learn about their culture in their own language is very important if we are to have a positive and informed view of the world outside our own country. Translation, both written and oral, plays a big role in the mixing of cultures, and Emma hopes to continue working in translation after finishing her studies. We need more translators in order to facilitate this connection between different cultures all over the world."
